# ML-Algorithms-from-Scratch
Here I have implemented some of the machine learning algorithms from scratch
1) In the linear regression, I have done 3 variants: Vanilla, Stochastic and Mini-Batch and "Synthetic.csv" is the required dataset.
2) In the K-Means, I have done 2 variants: K-Means and K-Means ++ and "KMeansDataset.csv" is the required dataset.
